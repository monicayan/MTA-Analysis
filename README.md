# MTA-Analysis
a project on MTA data

**NYC MTA Turnstile Usage Dataset**

-  *http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html*
-  This dataset shows entry & exit counter values for each turnstile-device in each station in the NYC Subway System.
-  Note these aren’t counts per interval, but equivalent to an “odometer” reading for each device.

**Data analysis:**

-  Which station has the most number of units as of today?
-  What is the total number of entries & exits across the subway system for August 1, 2013?
-  Let’s define the busy-ness as sum of entry & exit count. What station was the busiest on August 1, 2013? What turnstile was the busiest on that date?
-  What stations have seen the most usage growth/decline in 2013?
-  What dates in 2013 are the least busy? Could you identify days in 2013 on which stations were not operating at full capacity or closed entirely?

**Visualization:**

-  Plot the daily row counts for data files in Q3 2013.
-  Plot the daily total number of entries & exits across the system for Q3 2013.
-  Plot the mean and standard deviation of the daily total number of entries & exits for each month in Q3 2013 for station 34 ST-PENN STA.
-  Plot 25/50/75 percentile of the daily total number of entries & exits for each month in Q3 2013 for station 34 ST-PENN STA.
-  Plot the daily number of closed stations and number of stations that were not operating at full capacity in Q3 2013.
